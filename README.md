# Silver Spork

The aim of this repo is to teach users how to easily publish basic webmaps useing QGIS Desktop and GitHub Pages.

## TL;DR

- Create a [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) repository
- Create a basic web map with static assets. You can use libraries like Leaflet or OpenLayers to structure static html elements, or use QGIS Desktop with the QGIS2Web plugin to compile a customised web map to a collection of static assets which can be published to GitHub.

## ToS

Please note that GitHub pages is not intended as a free web hosting service and includes it's own terms of service which outline limitations on the acceptable use and activities for the service.

## Why silver spork

Ask the GitHub engineers and their odd adjective-noun bot. I figure they knew I never got a silver spoon so they were just teasing and I found it funny so I rolled with it.
